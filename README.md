HarfBuzz bindigs for Nim 

**This is mainly meant to be used internally in [nimskia](https://github.com/mvenditto/nimskia)**

notes:
  - the bindings does not cover the whole hb api
  - no tests yet
  - the nimgen.cfg is just a sketch and the bindings generation requires a manual step of preprocess
